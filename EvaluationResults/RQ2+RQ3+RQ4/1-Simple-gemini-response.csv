If ""MyApi"" refers to an existing API Gateway instance external to this template, you should use `!ImportValue` or retrieve the ID through other means.\n\n3. **Potential CORS Issues (Implicit):** The configuration doesn\'t explicitly address CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing). If your API needs to be accessed from different domains, you\'ll need to configure CORS on your API Gateway method. \n<END>']"
