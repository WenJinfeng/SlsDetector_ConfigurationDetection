The SQS event source mapping may require a 'MaximumBatchingWindowInSeconds' property to specify the maximum time to wait before invoking the function with a batch of messages.\n\n8. The 'Events' property should be checked to ensure that the SQS event is properly configured.

The 'StageName' variable is used in the FunctionName and Id properties, but it is not defined anywhere in the configuration. It should be defined as a parameter or a mapping.\n\n2. The 'CodeUri' property should be a string or an object with a 'Bucket' and 'Key' property, but the 'Bucket' property should be a reference to an S3 bucket resource, not a string. However, in this case, 'Mybucket' seems to be a string, not a reference to an S3 bucket resource.\n\n3. The 'Events' property in the S3VideoUploadEvent should be a list of strings, but 's3:ObjectCreated:*' is a single string. It should be wrapped in a list.\n\n4. The 'Id' property in the S3VideoUploadEvent should be a string, but it is using the '!Sub' function which is not necessary in this case.\n\n5. The 'S3Bucket' resource is defined after it is referenced in the 'MyFunc' resource. While this is not an error in CloudFormation, it is generally considered good practice to define resources before they are referenced.\n\n6. The 'S3Key' filter rules should be a list of objects with 'Name' and 'Value' properties, which is correct in this configuration. However, the 'Name' property should be either 'prefix' or 'suffix', and the 'Value' property should be a string. In this case, the configuration is correct.\n\n7. The 'Runtime' property is set to 'python3.9', which is a valid runtime for AWS Lambda. However, it is generally recommended to use the latest available runtime, which is currently 'python3.10' for Python.\n\n8. The 'Timeout' property is set to 900 seconds, which is the maximum allowed timeout for AWS Lambda functions. However, it is generally recommended to set the timeout to the minimum value necessary for the function to complete, to avoid unnecessary costs.\n\n9. The 'MemorySize' property is set to 2048 MB, which is a valid memory size for AWS Lambda functions. However, it is generally recommended to set the memory size to the minimum value necessary for the function to complete, to avoid unnecessary costs.\n<END>""]"

The \'Pattern\' property in the EventBridgeRule is missing the \'source\' field, which is a required field for EventBridgeRule patterns. However, this is not necessarily an error if the source is not needed for this specific rule.\n\n2. The \'detail-type\' field in the Pattern should be \'detailType\' (camelCase) instead of \'detail-type\' (kebab-case).\n\nSo the corrected configuration should be:\n```\nPattern:\n  detailType: [""Object Created""]\n```\nHowever, without knowing the exact requirements of the EventBridgeRule, it\'s hard to pinpoint other potential misconfigurations.\n\nOne more certain misconfiguration is:\n3. The \'Events\' property should be \'Events\' is not a valid property for AWS::Serverless::StateMachine. Instead, you should use \'EventBridgeConfiguration\' or define the event in the \'Events\' section of the AWS::Serverless::Function that this state machine is likely connected to.\n\n<END>']"
