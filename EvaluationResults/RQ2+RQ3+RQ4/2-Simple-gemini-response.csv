The `WebUIIndexTrigger` is redundant as `/` is already covered. \n* **CORS Configuration:** For the web UI to interact with the API endpoints, you'll need to configure Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) on the `ExampleHttpApi`.\n* **Error Handling:** Consider adding error handling mechanisms to your functions (e.g., using API Gateway's error responses or custom logic within your function code).\n* **Function Naming:**  `HoWorldFunction` seems like a typo and should likely be `HelloWorldFunction`.\n\nWhile the template is deployable, addressing these points will lead to a more robust and production-ready application. \n<END>""]"
