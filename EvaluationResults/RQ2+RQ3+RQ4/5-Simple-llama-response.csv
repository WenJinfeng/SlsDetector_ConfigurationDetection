However, one of them (`SimpleCase`) is missing the `Path` and `Method` properties, which are required for an `HttpApi` event. This will cause an error when trying to deploy the function.\n\n2. The `MyApi` resource has an `Auth` section that defines a `LambdaAuthorizer`, but there is no corresponding `AWS::Serverless::Function` resource that implements this authorizer. This will cause an error when trying to deploy the API.\n\n3. The `DefinitionBody` of the `MyApi` resource defines an OpenAPI specification with a single path `/` that has an `any` method. However, the `x-amazon-apigateway-integration` section is configured for an `http_proxy` integration, which is not compatible with the `any` method. This will cause an error when trying to deploy the API.\n\n4. The `CodeUri` property of the `HttpApiFunction` resource points to an S3 bucket, but it does not specify the version of the object. This can cause issues if the object is updated after the function is deployed.\n\n<END>']"

The \'someFunction\' is not defined in the given snippet. Make sure it is defined somewhere in the template.\n\n4. The \'aws_proxy\' integration type requires the \'credentials\' property to be specified if the Lambda function is not in the same account as the API Gateway.

The `RestApiId` property in the `ApiEvent` event of the `MyFunction` resource is referencing `MyApi`, but `MyApi` is of type `AWS::Serverless::Api`, which does not provide a `RestApiId`. Instead, you should use the `Ref` function to reference the `MyApi` resource directly in the `Events` section of the `MyFunction` resource.\n\n3. The `ResourcePolicy` in the `Auth` section of the `MyApi` resource is missing a `Version` property, which is required.\n\n4. The `ResourcePolicy` in the `Auth` section of the `MyApi` resource has an `AwsAccountWhitelist` property, but it should be `AwsAccountBlacklist` or `AwsAccountAllowList` (depending on the desired behavior) in the latest versions of AWS SAM. However, `AwsAccountWhitelist` is not a valid property in `ResourcePolicy`.\n\n5.
