The 'CompatibleRuntimes' property includes 'ruby2.5', which is a deprecated runtime. AWS Lambda no longer supports Ruby 2.5 as of July 2022. It is recommended to use a supported version, such as 'ruby2.7'.\n\n2. The 'ContentUri' property is set to '../layer', which is a relative path. While this might work in some cases, it's generally recommended to use an absolute path or an S3 URI to ensure the layer content is correctly resolved.\n\n<END>""]"
meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-405B-Instruct-Turbo,TESTSelect7.yaml,"[""<START>\n1. Missing `Role` property in the `AWS::Serverless::Function` resource. The `Role` property is required to specify the ARN of the IAM role that the function will assume.\n\n2. The `FunctionResponseType` should be a string, not a list. It should be set to `ReportBatchItemFailures` instead of a list containing `ReportBatchItemFailures`.\n\n3. The `InlineCode` property is deprecated and should be replaced with `CodeUri` or `InlineCode` should be used with `ZipFile` instead.\n\n4. The `Runtime` property should be checked to ensure that it matches the runtime of the code. In this case, it's set to `python3.9`, which is correct for a Python 3.9 function.\n\n5. The `Handler` property should be checked to ensure that it matches the handler of the code. In this case, it's set to `bar`, which matches the function name in the code.\n\n6. The `Events` property should be checked to ensure that it's correctly configured. In this case, it's set to an SQS event, which is correct.\n\nHowever, without knowing the specific requirements of the application, it's difficult to say for certain whether there are any other misconfigurations.\n<END>""]"
meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-405B-Instruct-Turbo,TESTSelect8.yaml,"[""<START>\n1. The 'StageName' variable is used in the FunctionName and Id properties, but it is not defined anywhere in the configuration. It should be defined as a parameter or a mapping to avoid errors.\n\n2. The 'CodeUri' property should be a string or an object with a 'Bucket' and 'Key' property, but the 'Bucket' property should be the actual name of the bucket, not a reference to another resource. However, in this case, 'Mybucket' seems to be a hardcoded string which might be incorrect if the actual bucket name is 'my-bucket-name' as defined in the 'S3Bucket' resource.\n\n3. The 'Id' property in the 'S3VideoUploadEvent' event should be a string that is unique among all events in the function, but it is using the 'StageName' variable which might not be defined. Also, the 'Id' property should not contain a colon (:).\n\n4. The 'Events' property in the 'S3VideoUploadEvent' event should be a list of strings, but it is a single string 's3:ObjectCreated:*'. It should be a list with one element, i.e., ['s3:ObjectCreated:*'].\n\n5. The 'S3Bucket' resource is defined after it is referenced in the 'MyFunc' resource. Although this is not an error in CloudFormation, it is a good practice to define resources before they are referenced.\n\n6. The 'Handler' property in the 'MyFunc' resource should be a string that is the entry point of the function, but it is hardcoded to 'handler.lambda_handler'. This might be incorrect if the actual handler is different.\n\n7. The 'Runtime' property in the 'MyFunc' resource should be a string that is a valid runtime, but it is hardcoded to 'python3.9'. This might be incorrect if the actual runtime is different.\n<END>""]"
meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-405B-Instruct-Turbo,TESTSelect9.yaml,"[""<START>\n1. The 'Pattern' property in the EventBridgeRule is missing the 'source' field, which is a required field for EventBridgeRule patterns. However, this is not necessarily an error if the source is not needed for this specific rule.\n\n2. The 'detail-type' field in the Pattern should be 'detailType' (camelCase) instead of 'detail-type' (kebab-case).\n\nSo, there is at least one certain misconfiguration:\n- The 'detail-type' field should be 'detailType'.\n\n</END>""]"
