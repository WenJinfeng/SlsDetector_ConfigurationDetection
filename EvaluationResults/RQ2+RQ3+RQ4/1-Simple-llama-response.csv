The 'RedrivePolicy' property in the 'MyFunctionTopicEventQueue' resource is referencing the 'MyDeadLetterQueue' resource, but it does not specify the maximum receive count for the dead-letter queue.

The `x-amazon-apigateway-integration` section in the `DefinitionBody` property of the `ApiGatewayApi` resource is missing the `requestTemplates` property, which is required for `aws_proxy` integration. However, since the `passthroughBehavior` is set to `when_no_match`, this might not be an issue if the request body is not being transformed.\n\n3. The `Events` section in the `LambdaFunction` resource is not necessary because the integration with the API Gateway is already defined in the `x-amazon-apigateway-integration` section of the `DefinitionBody` property of the `ApiGatewayApi` resource. This might cause duplicate integration configurations.\n\n4. The `Path` property in the `ProxyApiRoot` event of the `LambdaFunction` resource should be `/` instead of `/mypath` if you want to proxy all requests to the Lambda function.

Instead, you should use the `Broker` property to specify the Amazon MQ broker ARN and the `SecretsManager` secret should be used to store the credentials.\n\n2. The `Queues` property in the `HelloWorldFunction` resource is set to `HelloWorld`, but there is no configuration in the `HelloWorldBroker` resource to create a queue with this name. You should add a `Queues` property to the `HelloWorldBroker` resource to create the required queue.\n\n3. The `Users` property in the `HelloWorldBroker` resource is using the `resolve:secretsmanager` function to retrieve the password and username from the `HelloWorldSecret` secret. However, the `resolve:secretsmanager` function is not a valid CloudFormation function.

The `GenerateStringKey` property in the `HelloWorldSecret` resource is set to `password`, but the `SecretStringTemplate` property is set to `{""username"": ""admin""}`.

The `x-amazon-apigateway-binary-media-types` list includes both specific MIME types (e.g., `image/jpeg`) and a wildcard (`*/*`). The wildcard will override all other settings, so the specific MIME types are unnecessary.\n\n3.

The `RestApiId` property in the `GetResource` event should reference the `MyApi` resource using `!Ref MyApi`, but the `MyApi` resource is of type `AWS::Serverless::Api`, which is an API Gateway REST API or an API Gateway HTTP API. If it's an API Gateway REST API, the correct property to use is `RestApiId`. However, if it's an API Gateway HTTP API, the correct property to use is `ApiId`. The correct property to use depends on the type of API created by `AWS::Serverless::Api`.\n\n4.

The `DockerContext`, `DockerTag`, `Dockerfile`, and `SamResourceId` metadata properties are not configuration errors per se, but they are not necessary for the AWS::Serverless::Function resource to work correctly. They might be used by SAM CLI for building and deploying the function, but they can be removed from the final CloudFormation template.\n\n4. The `VpcConfig` property is specified, but it's missing the `SubnetIds` property should be a list of at least two subnets for high availability. Although it's not an error, it's a best practice to use multiple subnets.\n\n5. The `Events` property has an SNS event, but it's missing the `FilterPolicy` property.

The `Handler` property is specified in the `WebUIFunction` resource, but it is not necessary when using a `CodeUri` that points to a directory. The `Handler` property is used to specify the entry point of the Lambda function, but when using a directory, AWS Lambda will look for an `index` file (e.g., `index.js`, `index.py`, etc.) as the entry point.\n\n3. The `Runtime` property is specified in the `WebUIFunction` resource, but it is not necessary when using a `CodeUri` that points to a directory. The `Runtime` property is used to specify the runtime environment of the Lambda function, but when using a directory, AWS Lambda will automatically detect the runtime environment based on the files in the directory.\n\n4. The `HoWorldFunction` resource has an event with the same name (`Example`) as the event in the `ExampleFunction` resource. While this is not an error, it is a good practice to use unique names for events to avoid confusion.\n\n5.
