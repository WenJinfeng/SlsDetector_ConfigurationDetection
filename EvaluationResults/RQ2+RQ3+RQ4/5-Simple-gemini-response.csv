It tells Lambda which function to execute within your code.\n\n2. **Missing `CodeUri` Property:** The `CodeUri` property is essential as it points to the location of your Lambda function code. This could be an S3 bucket location or a local path if you're using SAM for deployment. \n\nLet me illustrate with an example of how to fix these errors:\n\n```yaml\nResources:\n  MySimpleFunction:\n    Type: AWS::Serverless::Function\n    Properties:\n      Function: !Sub 'my-simple-function-${Stage}'\n      Runtime: python3.8\n      Handler: app.handler  # Example handler, replace with your actual handler\n      CodeUri: s3://my-bucket/function.zip # Example code location\n```\n\n**Explanation of Fixes:**\n\n* **`Handler: app.handler`**: This assumes your function code has a file named `app.py` and within it, a function named `handler`. Adjust this based on your code structure.\n* **`CodeUri: s3://my-bucket/function.zip`**: This assumes your function code is packaged as `function.zip` and uploaded to an S3 bucket named `my-bucket`.
