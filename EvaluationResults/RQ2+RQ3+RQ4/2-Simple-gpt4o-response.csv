The `StockSellerFunction` is using `nodejs16.x` as the runtime, which is not consistent with the other functions using `nodejs18.x`. While this is not a configuration error per se, it might be an oversight if the intention was to use the same runtime version across all functions.\n\n3. The `DDBPutItem` substitution in the `StockTradingStateMachine` resource is using an incorrect syntax for the `arn` substitution. The correct syntax should be `!Sub 'arn:${AWS::Partition}:states:::dynamodb:putItem'`.\n\n4. The `UploadBucket` resource's `BucketName` property is using `!Ref BucketName`, which requires the `BucketName` parameter to be provided during stack creation. If the parameter is not provided, it will result in a stack creation error. Ensure that the parameter is correctly provided or consider using a default value.\n\n5. The `NotificationConfiguration` for the `UploadBucket` is set to use `EventBridgeConfiguration` with `EventBridgeEnabled: true`, but there is no explicit permission or rule defined to handle these events in the `StockTradingStateMachine`.

The `URI` should be the secret ARN, not a reference to the secret itself. Use `!GetAtt HelloWorldSecret.Arn` instead.\n\n3.

The `Handler` property is set to `index.handler`, but since the code is provided inline, there is no `index` file. The handler should match the function name in the inline code, which is `handler`.\n\n3. The `FunctionResponseTypes` property is used incorrectly. It should be placed under the `SQSEvent` configuration, but it is not a valid property for SQS event sources in AWS SAM. This property is used for asynchronous invocations, not for SQS events.\n\n4.

In the `Mappings` section, the `ZoneId` for the `Dev` environment is the same as the `Local` environment, which might be intentional but should be verified for correctness.\n\n3. The `ApiDomainCert` resource uses `!If` conditions to determine the `DomainName`, but the `isLocalDev` condition only checks for the `Local` environment. If the `Env` parameter is set to any other value, the `!FindInMap` function will be used, which might not be intended for environments other than `Local`.\n\n4. The `HttpApiGW` resource\'s `DomainName` property also uses the same `!If` condition logic as `ApiDomainCert`, which might not handle environments other than `Local` correctly.\n\n5. The `Outputs` section references `${HttpApiGW.DomainName}`, but `DomainName` is not a direct property of the `AWS::Serverless::HttpApi` resource. The correct reference should be to the `ApiEndpoint` or similar property, depending on the actual output of the `HttpApiGW` resource.\n\n6. The `Outputs` section\'s `Value` field uses `${HttpApiGW.DomainName}`, which is incorrect because `DomainName` is not a valid intrinsic property of the `HttpApiGW` resource. The correct property should be used, such as `ApiEndpoint`.\n\n7. The `CorsConfiguration` in `HttpApiGW` allows all methods with `AllowMethods: [""*""]`, which might not be a misconfiguration but should be reviewed for security implications.\n\n8. The `ApiDomainCert` resource\'s `DomainValidationOptions` uses `HostedZoneId` and `DomainName` with the same `!If` condition logic, which might not handle environments other than `Local` correctly.\n\n9. The `GetAnonymousSmsSendPageUrl` function has two `ApiCall` events with similar paths but different casing (`/AnonymousSmsSendPageUrl/` and `/anonymousSmsSendPageUrl/`).

The `RestApiId` property in the `GetResource` event configuration should be `RestApiId: !Ref MyApi` but it is not necessary to specify `RestApiId` when the API is defined in the same template. SAM automatically associates the function with the API defined in the same template.\n\n3. The `InlineCode` property in the `GetFunction` resource is not properly formatted. The code should be a string, and it should be properly escaped if necessary. The current code might not be correctly interpreted due to the lack of proper escaping or formatting.\n\n4. The `Access-Control-Expose-Headers` and `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` headers in the `GatewayResponses` configuration are not correctly formatted.

The `Events` property in the `MyFunction` resource has an event source named `Noneapi`, which is not a valid name. Event source names should be descriptive and follow naming conventions.\n\n3. The `Method` property under `Events` in the `MyFunction` resource is set to `get`, but the `RequestModel` property is specified. Request models are typically used with HTTP methods that have a request body, such as `POST` or `PUT`. Using a request model with a `GET` method is not appropriate.\n\n4. The `DeletionPolicy` for `TestLogGroupName` is set to `Delete`, which means the log group will be deleted when the stack is deleted. This might not be an error, but it's important to ensure this is the intended behavior, as it will result in the loss of all log data.\n\n5. The `InlineCode` property in the `MyFunction` resource is using a simple string for the function code.

For a Cognito User Pool authorizer, the `Type` should be set to `COGNITO_USER_POOLS`.\n\n2. The `AWS::ApiGateway::ApiKey` resource `MyFirstApiKey` has a `DependsOn` attribute that references `MyUsagePlan`, but `DependsOn` is not necessary for this configuration.

This is incorrect because `MyFunction` is defined later in the template, and CloudFormation does not support forward references. The correct way is to ensure that `MyFunction` is defined before `MyApi` or use `!GetAtt MyFunction.Arn`.\n\n2. The `MyLambdaAuthFunction` is using `event.queryStringParameters.authorization` to retrieve the authorization parameter. However, if the query string parameter is not provided, this will result in an error. It is advisable to add a check to ensure `queryStringParameters` is not null before accessing `authorization`.\n\n3. The `MyCognitoUserPoolClient` resource is missing the `AllowedOAuthFlows` and `AllowedOAuthScopes` properties, which are typically required when setting up a user pool client for authentication purposes. However, this might not be an absolute error if the client is not intended for OAuth flows.\n\n4. The `MyCognitoUserPoolClient` is missing the `ExplicitAuthFlows` property, which is often necessary to define the authentication flows that the client can use. This might not be an absolute error if the default flows are sufficient.\n\n5. The `MyLambdaAuthFunction` is using `context` in the return statement, but it is not being populated with any values. This might not be an error if no additional context is needed, but typically, context is used to pass additional information to the downstream services.\n\n6. The `MyFunction` and `MyLambdaAuthFunction` both have `InlineCode` with a `callback` parameter in the handler function, but the `callback` is not used. This is not an error per se, but it is unnecessary and can be removed for cleaner code.\n\n7. The `MyApi` resource's `Auth` section specifies `DefaultAuthorizer: MyLambdaRequestAuth`, but the `MyLambdaRequestAuth` authorizer is defined with `FunctionPayloadType: REQUEST`, which is correct.

The `AWS::Serverless::Api` resource `MyApi` has a `DefinitionBody` with `openapi: '3.0'`, but the paths section is not correctly defined for OpenAPI 3.0.

The `AWS::Serverless::Api` resource `MyApi` has a `payloadFormatVersion: '1.0'` in the `x-amazon-apigateway-integration`, which is not compatible with OpenAPI 3.0.
