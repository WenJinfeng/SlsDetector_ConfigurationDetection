The `StageName` property in the `ServerlessHttpApi` resource is set to `prod`. While not an error, it's important to ensure that this is the intended stage name, as it will affect the URL of the deployed API.\n\n4. The `InlineCode` in the `LambdaFunctionExample` resource is using Python 3.8, which is correct, but ensure that the AWS Lambda service still supports this runtime version as AWS periodically deprecates older runtime versions.\n\nNote: The above points are based on the provided configuration and AWS best practices.
