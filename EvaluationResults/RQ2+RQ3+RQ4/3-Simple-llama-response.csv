The `Events` property should be a list of event sources. In this case, it's a single event source, so it should be wrapped in a list.\n\nHowever, considering the provided code, here is the corrected version of the above points:\n\n1, 3, 4, 5, and 6 might be correct depending on the actual requirements and context of the code.\n\nOnly point 2 is absolutely certain.\n\nSo the answer is:\n2. The `FunctionResponseType` should be a string, not a list. It should be set to `ReportBatchItemFailures` instead of a list containing `ReportBatchItemFailures`.\n<END>""]"

The `StageName` variable is used in the `FunctionName` and `Id` properties, but it is not defined anywhere in the configuration. It should be defined as a parameter or a mapping.\n\n2. The `CodeUri` property should be a string or an object with a `Bucket` and `Key` properties, but the `Bucket` property should be a reference to an S3 bucket resource, not a string. In this case, it should be `!Ref S3Bucket` instead of `Mybucket`.\n\n3. The `Events` property in the `S3VideoUploadEvent` event should be a list of events, not a single event. It should be `Events: [s3:ObjectCreated:*]` instead of `Events: s3:ObjectCreated:*`.\n\n4. The `Id` property in the `S3VideoUploadEvent` event should be a string, not a substituted string. It's not an error, but it's not necessary to use `!Sub` in this case.\n\n5. The `S3Bucket` resource should have a unique name. If the bucket already exists, it's better to use the `AWS::S3::Bucket` resource with the `BucketName` property set to the existing bucket name, and the `DeletionPolicy` property set to `Retain` to prevent accidental deletion.\n\n<END>""]"
